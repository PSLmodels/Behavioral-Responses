    "detailed_description": "Behavioral-Responses, which is part of the Policy Simulation Library (PSL) collection of USA tax models, estimates partial-equilibrium behavioral responses to changes in the US federal individual income and payroll tax system as simulated by Tax-Calculator. It provides two ways of doing this: (1) the `response` function, which contains higher-level logic that supports the Tax-Brain 'Partial Equilibrium Simulation' capability and requires specification of only the elasticities, and (2) the `quantity_response` function, which contains lower-level logic that requires specification of the quantity whose response is to be estimated, requires specification of the marginal tax rates and elasticities to be used in the response calculation, and allows the response estimation to be conducted by subgroup with different elasticities for each subgroup.",
