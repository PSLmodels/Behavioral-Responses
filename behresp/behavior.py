def response(calc_1, calc_2, elasticities, dump=False, inplace=False):
    """
    Implements TaxBrain "Partial Equilibrium Simulation" dynamic analysis
    returning results as a tuple of Pandas DataFrame objects (df1, df2) where:
    df1 is extracted from a baseline-policy calc_1, and
    df2 is extracted from a reform-policy calc_2 that incorporates the
        behavioral responses given by the nature of the baseline-to-reform
        change in policy and elasticities in the specified behavior dictionary.

    Note: By default, this function internally modifies a copy of calc_2
      records to account for behavioral responses that arise from the
      policy reform that involves moving from calc1 policy to calc2
      policy.  Neither calc_1 nor calc_2 need to have had calc_all()
      executed before calling the response function. By default, neither
      calc_1 nor calc_2 are affected by this response function. To
      perform in-place calculations that affect calc_1 and calc_2, set
      inplace equal to True.

    The elasticities argument is a dictionary containing the assumed response
    elasticities.  Omitting an elasticity key:value pair in the dictionary
    implies the omitted elasticity is assumed to be zero.  Here is the full
    dictionary content and each elasticity's internal name:

     be_sub = elasticities['sub']
       Substitution elasticity of taxable income.
       Defined as proportional change in taxable income divided by
       proportional change in marginal net-of-tax rate (1-MTR) on taxpayer
       earnings caused by the reform.  Must be zero or positive.

     be_inc = elasticities['inc']
       Income elasticity of taxable income.
       Defined as dollar change in taxable income divided by dollar change
       in after-tax income caused by the reform.  Must be zero or negative.

     be_cg = elasticities['cg']
       Semi-elasticity of long-term capital gains.
       Defined as change in logarithm of long-term capital gains divided by
       change in marginal tax rate (MTR) on long-term capital gains caused by
       the reform.  Must be zero or negative.
       Read response function documentation (see below) for discussion of
       appropriate values.

    The optional dump argument controls the number of variables included
    in the two returned DataFrame objects.  When dump=False (its default
    value), the variables in the two returned DataFrame objects include
    just the variables in the Tax-Calculator DIST_VARIABLES list, which
    is sufficient for constructing the standard Tax-Calculator tables.
    When dump=True, the variables in the two returned DataFrame objects
    include all the Tax-Calculator input and calculated output variables,
    which is the same output as produced by the Tax-Calculator tc --dump
    option except for one difference: the tc --dump option provides two
    calculated variables, mtr_inctax and mtr_paytax, that are replaced
    in the dump output of this response function by mtr_combined, which
    is the sum of mtr_inctax and mtr_paytax.

    Note: the use here of a dollar-change income elasticity (rather than
      a proportional-change elasticity) is consistent with Feldstein and
      Feenberg, "The Taxation of Two Earner Families", NBER Working Paper
      No. 5155 (June 1995).  A proportional-change elasticity was used by
      Gruber and Saez, "The elasticity of taxable income: evidence and
      implications", Journal of Public Economics 84:1-32 (2002) [see
      equation 2 on page 10].

    Note: the nature of the capital-gains elasticity used here is similar
      to that used in Joint Committee on Taxation, "New Evidence on the
      Tax Elasticity of Capital Gains: A Joint Working Paper of the Staff
      of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget
      Office", (JCX-56-12), June 2012.  In particular, the elasticity
      use here is equivalent to the term inside the square brackets on
      the right-hand side of equation (4) on page 11 --- not the epsilon
      variable on the left-hand side of equation (4), which is equal to
      the elasticity used here times the weighted average marginal tax
      rate on long-term capital gains.  So, the JCT-CBO estimate of
      -0.792 for the epsilon elasticity (see JCT-CBO, Table 5) translates
      into a much larger absolute value for the be_cg semi-elasticity
      used by Tax-Calculator.
      To calculate the elasticity from a semi-elasticity, we multiply by
      MTRs from TC and weight by shares of taxable gains. To avoid those
      with zero MTRs, we restrict this to the top 40% of tax units by AGI.
      Using this function, a semi-elasticity of -3.45 corresponds to a tax
      rate elasticity of -0.792.
