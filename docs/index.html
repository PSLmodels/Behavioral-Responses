<h1 id="top">Using Behavioral-Responses</h1>

<p>This document tells you how to use Behavioral-Responses, an
open-source model in the Policy Simulation Library (PSL) collection of
USA tax models, the <b>lastest release</b> of which is:
<a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/RELEASES.md#2020-09-22-release-0110"
   target="_blank">0.11.0 (2020-09-22)</a>.</p>

<p>This documentation assumes that you have already read the
<a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses#behavioral-responses"
target="_blank">documentation introduction</a>.
You always use Behavioral-Responses in conjunction with the latest version
of <a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/" target="_blank">
Tax-Calculator</a>, the static-analysis model in the PSL collection of
USA tax models, by writing and executing a Python program.  For an
introduction to writing Python programs using Tax-Calculator, read the
tested recipes in our
<a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html"
target="_blank">Tax-Calculator Python Cookbook</a>.  If you want to
participate in the development of Behavioral-Responses &mdash; by
asking a question, reporting a bug, improving the documentation or
making an enhancement to the Python source code &mdash; you should go
to the <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses"
target="_blank">developer website</a>.</p>

<p>Please cite the source of your analysis as <q>Behavioral-Responses
release #.#.#, author's calculations.</q>  If you wish to link to
Behavioral-Responses, this page is preferred.  Additionally, we
strongly recommend that you describe the elasticity parameters used,
and provide a link to the materials required to replicate your
analysis or, at least, note that those materials are available upon
request.</p>

<h3 id="paramlogic">Response Parameters and Logic</h3>

<p>The Behavioral-Responses elasticity parameters and logic are
described in the
<a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/behresp/behavior.py"
target="_blank">behavior.py</a> file, where the <kbd>response</kbd> function
elasticities are defined in its docstring and the logic of how those
elasticities are used along with Tax-Calculator results is defined in the
higher-level <kbd>response</kbd> function.  The lower-level
<kbd>quantity_response</kbd> function is self-contained and described in
the functions's docstring.</p>

<h3 id="pyrecipe">Basic Python Recipe</h3>

<p>A tested recipe for using the Behavioral-Responses parameters and
<kbd>response</kbd> function is contained in Tax-Calculator Python Cookbook
<a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html#recipe02"
target="_blank">recipe 2</a> and
in the <kbd>test_response_function</kbd> in the
<a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses/blob/master/behresp/tests/test_behavior.py"
target="_blank">test_behavior.py</a> file.</p>

<p>Notice that when writing a program like this you must import both
the <kbd>taxcalc</kbd> package (to access Tax-Calculator) and
the <kbd>behresp</kbd> package (to access Behavioral-Responses).  Both
these conda packages can be installed on your computer using this
command at the operating-system command prompt:
<pre>
  conda install -c PSLmodels behresp
</pre>
Or, if you already have both of the packages installed but want to
upgrade them to the most recent versions, use these commands at the
operating-system command prompt:
<pre>
  conda update -c PSLmodels taxcalc
  conda update -c PSLmodels behresp
</pre>
</p>

<p>The Behavioral-Responses logic assumes that the elasticity
parameters apply to all filing units.  If you want to estimate
responses where the value of the elasticity parameters vary across
(say, earnings) groups, you can use the <kbd>quantity_response</kbd>
function.  A recipe for doing this is contained in
<a href="https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html#recipe04"
target="_blank">recipe 4</a> of the Tax-Calculator Python Cookbook.
That recipe simply estimates the responses.  But the techniques used
in the Behavioral-Responses <kbd>response</kbd> function can be used
to apply the estimated responses to the post-reform Tax-Calculator
object and recompute tax liabilities, producing tax liability
estimates that include the partial-equilibrium effects of the
estimated behavioral responses.</p>
